Encapsulation in Java
****************************************

Encapsulation is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming in Java.
It means wrapping data (variables) and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to the data.

-> In Java, encapsulation is achieved by:

  -- Declaring class variables as private

  -- Providing controlled access using public methods (getters and setters)

-> Encapsulation helps to:

   -- Protect data from unauthorized access

   -- Enforce validation and business rules

   -- Improve code maintainability and flexibility

   -- Reduce dependency between classes

By using encapsulation, the internal implementation of a class is hidden, and only the required functionality is exposed to the outside world.

-> One-line summary (optional)

Encapsulation is the process of hiding internal data and providing controlled access to it through methods.
